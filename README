libfprint is primarily licensed under the GNU LGPL. HOWEVER, THIS PRERELEASE
VERSION INCLUDES GPL CODE FROM LIBTHINKFINGER, therefore distribution is
subject to both the terms of the LGPL (see COPYING) *and* the GPL
(see COPYING.GPL).

At release time, I will contact libthinkfinger authors and see if they will
be happy to relicense. I expect they will.
