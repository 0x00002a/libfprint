libfprint is primarily licensed under the GNU LGPL. HOWEVER, THIS PRERELEASE
VERSION INCLUDES GPL CODE FROM LIBTHINKFINGER, therefore distribution is
subject to both the terms of the LGPL (see COPYING) *and* the GPL
(see COPYING.GPL).

libfprint includes code from NIST's NBIS software distribution:
http://fingerprint.nist.gov/NBIS/index.html
We include bozorth3 from the US export controlled distribution. We have
determined that it is fine to ship bozorth3 in an open source project,
see http://reactivated.net/fprint/US_export_control

At release time, I will contact libthinkfinger authors and see if they will
be happy to relicense. I expect they will.
