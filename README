libfprint
=========

libfprint is part of the fprint project:
http://www.reactivated.net/fprint

libfprint was originally developed as part of an academic project at the
University of Manchester with the aim of hiding differences between different
consumer fingerprint scanners and providing a single uniform API to application
developers. The ultimate goal of the fprint project is to make fingerprint
scanners widely and easily usable under common Linux environments.

For more information on libfprint, supported devices, API documentation, etc.,
see the homepage:

libfprint is primarily licensed under the GNU LGPL. HOWEVER, THIS PRERELEASE
VERSION INCLUDES GPL CODE FROM LIBTHINKFINGER, therefore distribution is
subject to both the terms of the LGPL (see COPYING) *and* the GPL
(see COPYING.GPL).

At release time, I will contact libthinkfinger authors and see if they will
be happy to relicense. I expect they will.

libfprint includes code from NIST's NBIS software distribution:

We include bozorth3 from the US export controlled distribution. We have
determined that it is fine to ship bozorth3 in an open source project,
