LIBRARY
=======
identification
test suite against NFIQ compliance set
make library optionally asynchronous and maybe thread-safe
nbis cleanups
track open devices, so we can close them during libfprint close
free memory during libfprint close
API function to determine if img device supports uncond. capture
race-free way of saying "save this print but don't overwrite"

NEW DRIVERS
===========
Sunplus 895 driver
AES1610 driver
AES2501 driver
AES3400/3500 driver
ID Mouse driver
Support for 2nd generation MS devices
Support for 2nd generation UPEK devices

IMAGING
=======
aes4000 doesn't work very well, maybe due to small minutia count?
PPMM parameter to get_minutiae seems to have no effect
nbis minutiae should be stored in endian-independent format
return images with standard enroll/verify call variants
